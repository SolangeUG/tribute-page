          Wangari Muta Maathai was born in Nyeri, a rural area of Kenya (Africa),
          on April 1st, 1940. She obtained a degree in Biological Sciences from
          Mount St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas (1964), a Master of
          Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh (1966), and pursued
          doctoral studies in Germany and the University of Nairobi, before
          obtaining a Ph.D. (1971) from the University of Nairobi, where she also
          taught veterinary anatomy.
          <br>
          <strong>The first woman in East and Central Africa
          to earn a doctorate degree</strong>, Professor Maathai became chair of the
          Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an associate professor in 1976 and
          1977 respectively. In both cases, she was the first woman to attain
          those positions in the region.

          Professor Maathai was active in the National Council of Women of Kenya
          (1976–1987) and was its chairman (1981–1987). In 1976, while she was
          serving in the National Council of Women, Professor Maathai introduced
          the idea of community-based tree planting. She continued to develop this
          idea into a broad-based grassroots organisation, the
          <span class="font-weight-bold">Green Belt Movement (GBM)</span>, whose
          main focus is poverty reduction and environmental conservation through
          tree planting.

          Professor Maathai was <span class="font-weight-bold">internationally
          acknowledged for her struggle for democracy, human rights, and
          environmental conservation, and served on the board of many organisations</span>.
          She addressed the UN on a number of occasions and spoke on behalf of
          women at special sessions of the General Assembly during the five-year
          review of the Earth Summit. She served on the Commission for Global
          Governance and the Commission on the Future.

          Professor Maathai represented the Tetu constituency in Kenya’s parliament
          (2002–2007), and served as Assistant Minister for Environment and Natural
          Resources in Kenya’s ninth parliament (2003–2007). In 2005, she was
          appointed Goodwill Ambassador to the Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem by the
          eleven Heads of State in the Congo region.
          <strong>The following year, 2006, she founded the Nobel Women’s
          Initiative with her sister laureates Jody Williams, Shirin Ebadi,
          Rigoberta Menchú Tum, Betty Williams, and Mairead Corrigan</strong>.
          In 2007, Professor Maathai was invited to be co-chair of the Congo
          Basin Fund, an initiative by the British and the Norwegian governments
          to help protect the Congo forests.

          In recognition of her deep commitment to the environment,
          <strong>the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General named Professor Maathai
          a UN Messenger of Peace in December 2009, with a focus on the environment
          and climate change.</strong> In 2010 she was appointed to the Millennium
          Development Goals Advocacy Group: a panel of political leaders, business
          people and activists established with the aim to galvanise worldwide
          support for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
          Also in 2010, Professor Maathai became a trustee of the Karura Forest
          Environmental Education Trust, established to safeguard the public land
          for whose protection she had fought for almost twenty years.
          That same year, <strong>in partnership with the University of Nairobi,
          she founded the Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental
          Studies (WMI).</strong> The WMI will bring together academic research
          —e.g. in land use, forestry, agriculture, resource-based conflicts,
          and peace studies—with the Green Belt Movement approach and members of
          the organisation.
