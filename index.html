              Wangari Muta Maathai was born in Nyeri, a rural area of Kenya (Africa),
              on April 1st, 1940. She obtained a degree in Biological Sciences from
              Mount St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas (1964), a Master of
              Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh (1966), and pursued
              doctoral studies in Germany and the University of Nairobi, before
              obtaining a Ph.D. (1971) from the University of Nairobi, where she also
              taught veterinary anatomy.
              <br>
              <strong>The first woman in East and Central Africa
              to earn a doctorate degree</strong>, Professor Maathai became chair of the
              Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an associate professor in 1976 and
              1977 respectively. In both cases, she was the first woman to attain
              those positions in the region.

              Professor Maathai was active in the National Council of Women of Kenya
              (1976–1987) and was its chairman (1981–1987). In 1976, while she was
              serving in the National Council of Women, Professor Maathai introduced
              the idea of community-based tree planting. She continued to develop this
              idea into a broad-based grassroots organisation, the
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Green Belt Movement (GBM)</span>, whose
              main focus is poverty reduction and environmental conservation through
              tree planting.

              environmental conservation, and served on the board of many organisations</span>.
              She addressed the UN on a number of occasions and spoke on behalf of
              women at special sessions of the General Assembly during the five-year
              review of the Earth Summit. She served on the Commission for Global
              Governance and the Commission on the Future.

              Professor Maathai represented the Tetu constituency in Kenya’s parliament

              Resources in Kenya’s ninth parliament (2003–2007). In 2005, she was
              appointed Goodwill Ambassador to the Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem by the
              eleven Heads of State in the Congo region.
              <strong>The following year, 2006, she founded the Nobel Women’s
              Initiative with her sister laureates Jody Williams, Shirin Ebadi,
              Rigoberta Menchú Tum, Betty Williams, and Mairead Corrigan</strong>.
              In 2007, Professor Maathai was invited to be co-chair of the Congo

              In recognition of her deep commitment to the environment,
              <strong>the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General named Professor Maathai
              a UN Messenger of Peace in December 2009, with a focus on the environment
              and climate change.</strong> In 2010 she was appointed to the Millennium
              Development Goals Advocacy Group: a panel of political leaders, business
              people and activists established with the aim to galvanise worldwide
              support for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
              Also in 2010, Professor Maathai became a trustee of the Karura Forest
              Environmental Education Trust, established to safeguard the public land
              for whose protection she had fought for almost twenty years.
              That same year, <strong>in partnership with the University of Nairobi,
              she founded the Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental
              Studies (WMI).</strong> The WMI will bring together academic research
              —e.g. in land use, forestry, agriculture, resource-based conflicts,
              and peace studies—with the Green Belt Movement approach and members of
              the organisation.
